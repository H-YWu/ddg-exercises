# ddg-exercises

My implementations for exercises of CMU [Discrete Differential Geometry](https://brickisland.net/DDGSpring2020/) (15-458/858).

Please refer to the original [README](./README_ddg.md) for details.

## Assignment 0: Combinatorial Surfaces

Apply the `link` operator many times started from a single vertex:

![links 1 vertex](./imgs/why/links-a-vertex.png)

Then apply the `star`, `closure`, and `boundary` operator:

![star closure boundary](./imgs/why/star-closure-boundary.png)

A "stable" state of applying the `link` operator multiple times started from the edges of a single triangle (pretty fun, huh?):

![links 3 edges](./imgs/why/links-3-edges.png)
